            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg tracking-wide uppercase mt-4">Website Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">We do not actually collect any information from our users other than the standard information that our website statistics automatically gathers (Awstats and Google Analytics). The following is just a standard Privacy Policy agreement (we do respect people&#39;s privacy!).</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(1) What information do we collect?</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(a) information about your visits to and use of this website;</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(b) information about any transactions carried out between you and us on or in relation to this website, including information relating to any purchases you make of our goods or services;</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(c) information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us and/or subscribing to our website services and/or email notifications.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(2) Information about website visits</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">We may collect information about you computer and your visits to this website such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views. We may use this information in the administration of this website, to improve the website&#39;s usability, and for marketing purposes.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">We may send a cookie which may be stored on by your browser on your computer&#39;s hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website&#39;s usability and for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to recognise your computer when you visit our website, and to personalise our website for you. Our advertisers may also send you cookies.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookie by clicking &quot;Tools&quot;, &quot;Internet Options&quot;, &quot;Privacy&quot;, and selecting &quot;Block all cookies&quot; using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(3) Using your personal data</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">Personal data submitted on this website will be used for the purposes specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may use your personal information to:</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(a) improve your browsing experience by personalising the website;</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(b) send information (other than marketing communications) to you which we think may be of interest to you by post or by email or similar technology;</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(c) send to you marketing communications relating to our business [or the businesses of carefully-selected third parties] which we think may be of interest to you by post or, where you have specifically agreed to this, by email or similar technology (you can inform us at any time if you no longer require marketing communications to be sent by Emailing us.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(d) provide other companies with statistical information about our users - but this information will not be used to identify any individual user. We will not without your express consent provide your personal information to any third parties for the purpose of direct marketing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(4) Other disclosures</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may disclose information about you:</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(a) to the extent that we are required to do so by law;</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(b) in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(c) in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk); and</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(d) to the purchaser or seller (or prospective purchaser or seller) of any business or asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling or purchasing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">Except as provided in this privacy policy, we will not provide your information to third parties.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(5) International data transfers</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(6) Security of your personal data</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">We will take reasonable precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. Of course, data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">(7) Policy amendments</p>
            <p class="paragraph my-4">We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version on our website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes.</p>
